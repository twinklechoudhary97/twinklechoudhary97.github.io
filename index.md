## Hi, I am Twinkle Choudhary

I'm currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science from University of California, San Diego.

Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Apple.

My industry experience involves working with complex and large-scale software systems.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lWqGXcUSqQv33YJsRtTx6JIMNCdw3W4Q/view?usp=sharing) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/twinklechoudhary97/twinklechoudhary.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
